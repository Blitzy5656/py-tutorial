            Have you ever wanted to learn to learn how to code? Well,
            Python is an excellent language for doing just that. But before
            you start making some of your own code it would be helpful to
            know the basic concepts.<br><br>

            <h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
            <p>One of the most important things in any programming language
            are called <dfn>variables</dfn>. You can think of <dfn>variables</dfn>
            as if they were a box with stuff in them. Here is an example of 
            how a <dfn>variable</dfn> might be used in a real program:</p>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <var>emails</var> = <span class="numberHL">10</span>

                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"You have:"</span>)
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>emails</var>)
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"email(s)"</span>)
            </div>
            <p>This may be a little confusing so let me break it down for you.</p><br>
            <p>First, at the very start of the program, we set the <dfn>variable</dfn> like this:</p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Type the <dfn>variable's</dfn> name. This MUST start with either an upper/lowercase character or 
            an underscore (_)</li>
                <li>Type a space.</li>
                <li>Type an equals sign (=). This assigns the <dfn>variable<dfn> with its property. You can think of it 
                like labeling a box.</li>
                <li>Type your <dfn>variable</dfn>. This can be a number, like in the example above, a string of text (remember to enclose
                that string of text in either single ('') or double ("") quotes), or another <dfn>variable</dfn>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>What does the <samp>print()</samp> function do? This <dfn>function</dfn> simply
            writes a line of text onto the screen. 
            So, here is what all of those <samp>print()</samp> <dfn>functions</dfn> do:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first <samp>print()</samp> writes "You have:" onto the screen</li>
              <li>Then, the next <samp>print()</samp> writes our variable onto the screen.</li>
              <li>Finally, the last <samp>print()</samp> writes "email(s)" onto the screen.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="Loops">Loops (for, while)</h2>
            <p><dfn>Loops</dfn> are an incredibly important part of all code. They are used primarily to repeat sections of code 
                multiple times without writing it multiple times. There are two different types of <dfn>loops</dfn>, which are both shown below.</p>
            <h3>For loops:</h3>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <span class="keywordHL">for</span> <var>x</var> <span class="keywordHL">in</span> <span class="functionHL">range</span>(<span class="numberHL">2</span>, <span class="numberHL">6</span>):
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>x</var>)
            </div>
            This code will output:
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                2
                3
                4
                5
            </div>
            <p>If you couldn't tell, <samp>for loops</samp> will take a variable, in this case <var>x</var>, and repeat it through a <dfn>function</dfn> or string, which is <samp>range(2,6)</samp> here. Every time the <dfn>variable</dfn> (<var>x</var>) increments, all the code indented in the <dfn>loop</dfn> will run.</p>
            <h3>While loops:</h3>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <var>i</var> = <span class="numberHL">1</span>
                <span class="keywordHL">while</span> <var>i</var> &lt; <span class="numberHL">6</span>:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>i</var>)
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keywordHL">if</span> <var>i</var> == <span class="numberHL">3</span>:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"i equals 3"</span>)
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>i</var> += <span class="numberHL">1</span>
            </div>
            This code will output:
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                1
                2
                3
                i equals 3
                4
                5
            </div>
            <p><samp>While loops</samp> run the code indented below them until the condition specified (<samp>i &lt; 6</samp> in this case) is false. This can be used to create an infinite <dfn>loop</dfn> (<samp>While True:</samp>), though this can be a stress to your computer and is generally considered bad practice.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="Conditionals">Conditionals (if-else statements)</h2>
            <p><dfn>Conditionals</dfn> tell your computer whether or not to do something. You have already seen an example of this above with the <samp>if i == 3</samp> in the <samp>while loop</samp>. The most common types of <dfn>conditionals</dfn> are <samp>if</samp> and <samp>if-else</samp> statements. </p>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <var>a</var> = <span class="numberHL">200</span>
                <var>b</var> = <span class="numberHL">33</span>
                <span class="keywordHL">if</span> <var>b</var> > <var>a</var>:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"b is greater than a"</span>)
                <span class="keywordHL">elif</span> <var>a</var> == <var>b</var>:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"a and b are equal"</span>)
                <span class="keywordHL">else</span>:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"a is greater than b"</span>)
            </div>
            <p>This might look complicated, but in reality it's pretty simple. First off we define <var>a</var> as 200 and <var>b</var> as 33.
            Then we get to the first <samp>if</samp> statement (<samp>if b &gt; a</samp>), which is going to run the code indented below if the condition is true, which in this case it won't because <var>b</var> isn't greater than <var>a</var>. Now the next statement, the <samp>elif</samp> is a combined else and if statement. This means that it will run if the condition in the if statement (<samp>b &gt; a</samp>) isn't true, AND if the condition in the elif (<samp>a == b</samp>) is true. Keep in mind that in python you use double equals (==) for an if statement, since a single equals sign will change one value to another, i.e. <samp>a = 10</samp> changes the value of <var>a</var> to 10, while <samp>a == 10</samp> returns true if <var>a</var> is equal to 10. Finally, the last statement, the <samp>else:</samp> line. This will run if the if, or in this case elif, returns false. 
            <br><br> So let's see this in action! With <var>a</var> equal to 200 and <var>b</var> to 33, we get the following result: </p>
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                a is greater than b
            </div>
            <p>Let's work through this. First the computer goes to the if statement and checks if b &gt; a, which it isn't, so it move on to the elif. this also returns false becuase 200 does not equal 33. this leaves only the else statement, which prints out
                that a is greater than b. Notice that we didn't check if a was actually greater than b, because we know it has to be if both b &gt; a and a == b aren't true. Now let's try with different numbers, say a = 2 and b = 10.
            </p>
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                b is greater than a
            </div>
            <p> Here we still start with the first if, but this time it returns true, so we run that first print statement, and since that if returned true, the computer doesn't run the elif or the else. Finally, if a and b were both the same number, say 20, what would happen?</p>
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                a and b are equal
            </div>
            <p>You probably expected that, but just to make sure you know, here's what happened. We starrt with the <samp>if</samp> again, but since it's false we move on to the <samp>elif</samp>. We treat elifs much the same as normal ifs, so we check its condition and it's true, so we print that <span class="variableHL">a</span> equals <span class="variableHL">b</span>. And again, since the <samp>elif</samp> was true, we do not run the <samp>else</samp> statement.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>
            <p><dfn>Functions</dfn> are like a reusable bag or backpack. They contain code that can be resued any time you want. This is incredebly useful if you have a lot of code in different places that are similar. You can even add variables into functions for different outputs, which you can see below.</p> 
            <div class="codeBox">
                <span class="keywordHL">def</span> <span class="functionHL">name_function</span>(<var>fname</var>, <var>lname</var>):
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>fname</var> + " " + <var>lname</var>)

                <span class="functionHL">name_function</span>(<span class="stringHL">"John"</span>, <span class="stringHL">"Doe"</span>)
            </div>
            Outputs:
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                John Doe
            </div>
            <p>This code probably seems confusing, but let's break it down.<!--let me break it down for you, mark ahh sentance--></p>
            <ol>
                <li><samp>def <span class="functionHL">name_function</span>(<var>fname</var>, <var>lname</var>):</samp>. This is the line that defines the function. We always start this with <dfn>def</dfn>, then the name of the function and some parentheses. The <var>fname</var> and <var>lname</var> are the function variables, and are always put in those parentheses.</li>
                <li><samp><span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>fname</var> + <span class="stringHL">" "</span> + <var>lname</var>)</samp>. This line is the content of our function, and what will be doen when we call our function. In this case we print out what we define for the <var>fname</var>, a space, and <var>lname</var>.</li>
                <li><samp><span class="functionHL">name_function</span>(<span class="stringHL">"John"</span>, <span class="stringHL">"Doe"</span>)</samp>. This is where we call our function, and where the code actually runs. First we write the name of the function and then we put the values we want for <var>fname</var> and <var>lname</var> in the parentheses, which in this case is John for <var>fname</var> and Doe for <var>lname</var>. This will run our function with these variables, which is the print statement from before. </li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="Lists">Lists</h2>
            <p>And finally, the last part of this lesson, lists. These are pretty much exaclty what they sound like, just a list of values stored like a variable. These values can be strings (letters), numbers, variables, or even other lists. Let's look at an example.</p>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <var>fruits</var> = [<span class="stringHL">"apple"</span>, <span class="stringHL">"banana"</span>, <span class="stringHL">"cherry"</span>]

                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>fruits</var>[<span class="numberHL">0</span>])
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>fruits</var>[<span class="numberHL">1</span>])
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>fruits</var>[<span class="numberHL">2</span>])
            </div>
            Outputs:
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                apple
                banana
                cherry
            </div>
            <p>First, we create a <dfn>variable</dfn> called <samp>fruits</samp> and assign a <dfn>list</dfn> to it. A <dfn>list</dfn> is just a collection of objects. We can <dfn>print</dfn> this list out 
            using the <samp>print()</samp> <dfn>function</dfn> like in the example.</p> An important thing to know about Python is that, like some other languages, the first value in a <dfn>list</dfn> has the value
            of 0, the second object has the value of 1, the third having the value of 2, and so on. That is why we start by printing the 0th object in the <dfn>list</dfn> first instead of the 1st object; because the 1st object is the second object. 
            <ol>
                <li>The first <samp>print</samp> writes the object in the 0 position; or the first object in the <dfn>list</dfn>, which is "apple".</li>
                <li>The second <samp>print</samp> writes the object in the 1 position; or the second object in the <dfn>list</dfn>, which is "banana".</li>
                <li>The last <samp>print</samp> writes the object in the 2 position; or the third object in the <dfn>list</dfn>, which is "cherry".</li>
            </ol>
