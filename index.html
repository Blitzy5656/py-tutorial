            <h1 class="mainHeader">Simple Python Introduction</h1>
            Have you ever wanted to learn to learn how to code? Well,
            Python is an excellent language for doing just that. But before
            you start making some of your own code it would be helpful to
            know the basic concepts.<br><br>

            <h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
            <p>One of the most important things in any programming language
            are called variables. You can think of variables
            as if they were a box with stuff in them. Here is an example of 
            how a variable might be used in a real program:</p>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <var>emails</var> = <span class="numberHL">10</span>

                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"You have:"</span>)
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>emails</var>)
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"email(s)"</span>)
            </div>
            <p>This may be a little confusing so let me break it down for you.</p><br>
            <p>First, at the very start of the program, we set the variable like this:</p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Type the variable's name. This MUST start with either an upper/lowercase character or 
            an underscore (_)</li>
                <li>Type a space.</li>
                <li>Type an equals sign (=). This assigns the variable with its property. You can think of it 
                like labeling a box.</li>
                <li>Type your variable. This can be a number, like in the example above, a string of text (remember to enclose
                that string of text in either single ('') or double ("") quotes), or another variable.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>What does the <samp>print()</samp> function do? This function simply
            writes a line of text onto the screen. 
            So, here is what all of those <samp>print()</samp> functions do:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first <samp>print()</samp> writes "You have:" onto the screen</li>
              <li>Then, the next <samp>print()</samp> writes our variable onto the screen.</li>
              <li>Finally, the last <samp>print()</samp> writes "email(s)" onto the screen.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="Loops">Loops (for, while)</h2>
            <p>Loops are an incredibly important part of all code. They are used primarily to repeat sections of code 
                multiple times without writing it multiple times. There are two different types of loops, which are both shown below.</p>
            <h3>For loops:</h3>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <span class="functionHL">for</span> <var>x</var> <span class="functionHL">in</span> <span class="functionHL">range</span>(<span class="numberHL">2</span>, <span class="numberHL">6</span>):
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>x</var>)
            </div>
            This code will output:
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                2
                3
                4
                5
            </div>
            <p>If you couldn't tell, for loops will take a variable, in this case <var>x</var>, and repeat it through a function or string, which is <samp>range(2,6)</samp> here. Every time the variable (<var>x</var>) increments, all the code indented in the loop will run.</p>
            <h3>For loops:</h3>
            <div class="codeBox">
                <var>i</var> = <span class="numberHL">1</span>
                <span class="functionHL">while</span> <var>i</var> &lt; <span class="numberHL">6</span>:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>i</var>)
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">if</span> <var>i</var> == <span class="numberHL">3</span>:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="functionHL">print</span>(<span class="stringHL">"i equals 3"</span>)
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>i</var> += <span class="numberHL">1</span>
            </div>
            This code will output:
            <div class="codeBox consoleLog">
                1
                2
                3
                i equals 3
                4
                5
            </div>
            <p>While loops run the code indented below them until the condition specified (<samp>i &lt; 6</samp> in this case) is false. this can be used to create an infinite loop (<samp>While True:</samp>), though this can be a stress to your computer and is generally considered bad practice.</p>
            <h2 id="Conditionals">Conditionals (if-else statements)</h2>
            <p>Conditionals tell your computer whether or not to do something. You have already seen an example of this above with the <samp>if i == 3</samp> in the while loop. the most common types of conditionals are if and if-else statements. </p>
            <div class="codeBox">
                a = 200
                b = 33
                if b > a:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("b is greater than a")
                elif a == b:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("a and b are equal")
                else:
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(<span class="stringHL">"a is greater than b"</span>)
            </div>
            <p>This might look complicated, but in reality it's pretty simple. first off we define <var>a</var> as 200 and <var>b</var> as 33.
            Then we get to the first if statement (<samp>if b &gt; a</samp></p>
