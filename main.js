you know what? STD (mr swaggs diss) lyrics

Young enough to die
And I'm rich enough to fuck
Yeah I came from the bottom baby
I'm not getting stuck
We sip lean by the litre like (bubble bubble bubble)
We sip lean by the litre like (bubble bubble bubble)
Cooking king krab on the stove wit da formula
Whippin Lamborghini in Bikini tryna run it up
Sippin' on the leany while I'm leaning out the passenger
Poppin' up on crabs like papparazzi ima snap him up
It's like it's Biggie versus Tupac
It's no biggie I smoke two packs uh
My shit is cold it's a new track (Brrrr)
I own the city and they knew that
I'm eating burgers made of light yeah
This my buzz and this my light year
Fuck this bitch up with my woody
I'm the kid just like I'm cudi
MR Krabs you know I'm right here
My bitch don't rag
She a PC
I got the mac
I press delete
I press the trigger at a Krab
And I'm itchin for the cash
Like I had an S T D
No, you not a Krab
You a rat boy
Talkin' to police
Huh? Fat boy?
I catch him when he lackin'
Out in traffic yeah my choppa automatic
So you know it's gunna clap boy
I got pearls on my neck
I'm at the chum bucket
I got pearl givin' neck
Cause she a cum bucket
You already sucked this dick
Bitch you can't unsuck it
Your dad a krab and I'm a demon he should run from me
Young enough to die
And I'm rich enough to fuck
Yeah I came from the bottom baby
I'm not getting stuck
We sip lean by the litre like (bubble bubble bubble)
We sip lean by the litre like (bubble bubble bubble)
Cooking king krab on the stove wit da formula
Whippin Lamborghini in Bikini tryna run it up
Sippin' on the leany while I'm leaning out the passenger
Poppin' up on crabs like papparazzi ima snap him up
