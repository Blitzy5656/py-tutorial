            Have you ever wanted to learn to learn how to code? Well,
            Python is an excellent language for doing just that. But before
            you start making some of your own code it would be helpful to
            know the basic concepts.<br><br>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            One of the most important things in any programming language
            are called variables. You can think of variables
            as if they were a box with stuff in them. Here is an example of 
            how a variable might be used in a real program:
            <br>
            <div class="code">
                <var>emails</var> = <span class="numberHL">10</span>

                <span class="functionHL">print</span>("You have:")
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>(<var>emails</var>)
                <span class="functionHL">print</span>("email(s)")
            </div>
            <br>
            This may be a little confusing so let me break it down for you.<br>
            First, at the very start of the program, we set the variable like this:<br> 
            1. Type the variable's name. This MUST start with either an upper/lowercase character or 
            an underscore (_).<br>
            2. Type a space.<br>
            3. Type an equals sign (=). This assigns the variable with its property. You can think of it 
            like labeling a box.<br> 
            4. Type your variable. This can be a number, like in the example above, a string of text (remember to enclose
            that string of text in either single ('') or double ("") quotes), or another variable.<br> 
            What does the <samp>print()</samp> function do? This function simply
            writes a line of text onto the screen. 
            So, here is what all of those <samp>print()</samp> functions do:<br>
            1. The first <samp>print()</samp> writes "You have:" onto the screen<br>
            2. Then, the next <samp>print()</samp> writes our variable onto the screen.<br>
            3. Finally, the last <samp>print()</samp> writes "email(s)" onto the screen.<br>
            <h2>Loops (for, while)</h2>
            <h2>Conditionals (if-else statements)</h2>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <h2>Lists</h2>
        </div>
